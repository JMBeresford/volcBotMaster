# volcBotMaster
## ~~Shitty~~ discord bot with zero aspirations but infinite potential

### This project was started as a means to learn python and working with data etc.
### Expect jank and low efficiency all around :^)
### This Readme will be updated as I progress through the below Roadmap. Expect install instructions and reference documentation at an **_extremely_** slow pace, as I will have to rediscover my own efforts when I go back to document them.

   - Modular source-code for development

3. Keep track of all user data for use in the following - ~75% completion

4. Permissions system - ~50% completion

5. Provide visualizations of user data/server statistics - ~5% completion

6. Server moderation functionality - ~idk% completion
