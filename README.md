# volcBotMaster
## ~~Useless~~ discord bot with zero aspirations but infinite potential

### This project was started as a means to learn python and working with data etc.
### Expect jank and low efficiency all around :^)
### This Readme will be updated as I progress through the below Roadmap. Expect install instructions and reference documentation at an **_extremely_** slow pace, as I will have to rediscover my own efforts as I go back to document them.
