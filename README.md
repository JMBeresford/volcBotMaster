# volcBotMaster
## ~~Shitty~~ discord bot with zero aspirations but infinite potential

### This project was started as a means to learn python and working with data etc.
### Expect jank and low efficiency all around :^)
### This Readme will be updated as I progress through the below Roadmap. Expect install instructions and reference documentation at an **_extremely_** slow pace, as I will have to rediscover my own efforts when I go back to document them.

## Prime Directives:

    I.      Obtain Knowledge - 0% completion
    
    II.     Keep all functionality modular on two levels - completion scales with project
            
        A.      Server-specific data for users
   
        B.      Modular source-code for development
            
    III.    Keep track of all user data for use in the following - ~75% completion
    
    IV.     Permissions system - ~50% completion
    
    V.      Provide visualizations of user data/server statistics - ~5% completion
    
    VI.     Server moderation Functionality - ~idk% completion
    
    
## Secondary Objectives:

    I.      Maybe some fun stuff 
> think !penis cog from [Twentysix26's bot](https://github.com/Twentysix26/26-Cogs)
    
        A.      !penis command
        
        B.      !quote(s) - this one will happen
    
    II.     Game??!
    
    III.    DDOS on @mention
    
    IV.     Interact with online data/API's
    
        A.      League of Legends comes to mind
        
        B.      Cryptocurrency pricing
        
    V.      Order delivery from #general (maybe store credit card info, unsure)
    
    [-1].   (try to) Maintain shit codebase
    
## Tertiary Tasks:

    I.      Have fun
